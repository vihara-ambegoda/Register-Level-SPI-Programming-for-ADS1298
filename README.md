# Register Level SPI Programming for ADS1298

Register-Level SPI Programming for ADS1298 ECG/EEG Front End

This repository contains the work I completed during my internship at Premium International, where I was assigned the task of performing **register-level programming** for the Texas Instruments **ADS1298 ECG/EEG Analog Front End** using an **Arduino Mega** via SPI communication.

The aim was to establish reliable SPI communication between the ADS1298 Evaluation Module (ADS1298RECG-FE) and Arduino Mega, configure the required registers (CONFIG1, CONFIG2, CONFIG3), and verify functionality through the Arduino Serial Monitor.

## 🔧 Hardware Used
- **Arduino Mega 2560**
- **ADS1298RECG-FE Evaluation Module (EVM)**
- Custom voltage divider circuits for 5V-to-3.3V level shifting
- Jumper configurations as per EVM manual

---

## 💡 Why Arduino Mega was Used
The ADS1298RECG-FE EVM is typically controlled via the MMB0 Modular EVM Motherboard, but the available MMB0 unit was faulty.
To avoid delays, an Arduino Mega 2560 was used as an alternative SPI master.
This required designing the hardware interface (including voltage dividers) and writing custom register-level SPI code from scratch.

## 🛠 About the SPI Registers Configured

- **CONFIG1** – Controls the **sampling rate** and enables/disables certain operating modes.  
  For example, it sets how many samples per second (SPS) are captured from the ECG/EEG inputs.

- **CONFIG2** – Manages **internal test signals** and **reference buffer settings**.  
  It allows enabling test waveforms for debugging and configuring how the reference voltage is handled.

- **CONFIG3** – Controls the **internal reference voltage source** and **lead-off detection circuitry**.  
  Lead-off detection helps identify if an electrode connection to the patient is loose or missing.

These settings define the basic operating conditions of the ADS1298 and are essential for accurate signal acquisition.
